# Who's That Pokemon!

A janky, handmade game by Dev.

To setup for local development:
1. Install dependencies with `npm i`. 
2. Run `npm start` at the root of the project. Take note of the port number.
3. Open web browser and navigate to `localhost:(your port number here)`

Alternatively, ensure you have the Heroku CLI installed and run `heroku local` at the root of the project. Then, you can visit localhost:port to see the game. 

### How to Play steps
This game is intended to be played while all players are in a voice call with each other.

1. The host chooses a Pokemon. Any Pokemon. What regions and generations are valid is up to the group to decide.
2. The host then proceeds to describe the Pokemon in any way they desire: the stranger and more obscure, the merrier! The difficulty of the game is determined by how the host chooses to describe the Pokemon. 
3. As the host submits descriptions, all players try to draw what they think it could look like.
4. When players are done, they submit their drawing and try to guess what Pokemon it is.
5. All guesses and drawings are revealed either when the host ends the game, or when all players have submitted their guesses and drawings.


For example:

An extremely easy way to describe this could be: `it looks like a snowman!`

A more difficult way to describe this could be: `There are two orbs atop each other, and there's a meteor about to crash in from the top left!`
