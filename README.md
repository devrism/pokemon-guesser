# Who's That Pokemon!

A janky, handmade game by Dev.

To setup for local development:
1. Install dependencies with `npm i`. 
2. Run `npm start` at the root of the project. Take note of the port number.
3. Open web browser and navigate to `http:localhost:(your port number here)`

Alternatively, ensure you have the Heroku CLI installed and run `heroku local` at the root of the project. Then, you can visit localhost:port to see the game.
